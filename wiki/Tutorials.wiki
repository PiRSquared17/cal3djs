= Core Model Handling =

In Cal3DJS, every model instance is based on a core model, which therefore must be created first. All the shared data, such as animations, meshes and materials, need to be loaded, and a few additional steps are necessary to finish the setup of the material handling. 

== Creation ==

First of all, we need to create an instance of the Cal3D.CalCoreModel class. The constructor take a single argument as a description of the core model.
{{{
var myCoreModel = new Cal3D.CalCoreModel('myHero');
}}}

== Data Loading ==

The next step is to load the skeleton data. Note that there can be only one skeleton per core model and it should be loaded before any other type of data. Use the Cal3D.CalLoader.loadCoreSkeletonFromFile() function to do this by providing the URL of the skeleton file and a callback object to retrieve the loaded core model or some information in case that any error happened.
{{{
var skeletonCallback = {};

skeletonCallback.onload = function(coreSkeleton, url) {
	myCoreModel.setCoreSkeleton(coreSkeleton);
};

skeletonCallback.onerror = function(errorCode, url) {
	// error handling ...
};

skeletonCallback.onprogress = function(progress, url) {
	// show progress ...
};

Cal3D.CalLoader.loadCoreSkeletonFromFile('hero.xsf', skeletonCallback);
}}}
