= Core Model Handling =

In Cal3DJS, every model instance is based on a core model, which therefore must be created first. All the shared data, such as animations, meshes and materials, need to be loaded, and a few additional steps are necessary to finish the setup of the material handling. 

== Creation ==

First of all, we need to create an instance of the Cal3D.CalCoreModel class. The constructor take a single argument as a description of the core model.

var myCoreModel = new Cal3D.CalCoreModel('myHero');
